          <h3>Getting Started with HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every website
            on the internet. It is used to structure content such as text,
            images, links, and forms. Without HTML, web pages would not exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a beginner, learning HTML helps you understand how browsers read
            and display content. Tags like h1, p, ul, and a define meaning and
            structure. Semantic HTML also improves accessibility and SEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is easy to learn and is the first step toward becoming a
            frontend developer.

          <h3>My Frontend Learning Journey</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning frontend development by understanding HTML
            basics. At first, it felt simple, but I soon realized the importance
            of writing clean and structured code. After HTML, I explored CSS to
            style web pages and learned how layouts work. Building small
            projects helped me gain confidence and practical experience. This
            journey taught me consistency, problem-solving, and the value of
            learning step by step.
